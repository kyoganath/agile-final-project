**As a** store administrator, 
**I need** the ability to delete a product from the catalog, 
**So that** I can remove products that are no longer available or relevant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Given I know the unique identifier of a product, 
    When I request to delete the product, 
    Then the product should be successfully removed from the catalog.
*   Given I attempt to delete a product that does not exist, 
    When I make the delete request, 
    Then the system should return an appropriate error message.
