**As a** customer, 
**I need** the ability to query a subset of products in the catalog based on specific criteria (e.g., category, price range, search keywords), 
**So that** I can easily find the products I am looking for.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Given I provide search criteria (e.g., keywords, category, price range), 
    When I submit the query, 
    Then the system should return a list of products that match the specified criteria.
*   The search should be case-insensitive and support partial matches.
