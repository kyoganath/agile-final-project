**As a** development team, 
**I need** the ability to host the product catalog on a cloud platform, 
**So that** the application is accessible and scalable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The product catalog should be deployed to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   The deployed application should be accessible to users via a web address.
*   The cloud infrastructure should be configured for scalability to handle increasing traffic.

**Note:** 
Consider using a containerization solution like Docker and a container orchestration service like Kubernetes for deployment.
