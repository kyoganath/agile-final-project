**As a** store administrator, 
**I need** the ability to retrieve a specific product from the catalog, 
**So that** I can view its details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Given I know the unique identifier of a product, 
    When I request the product details, 
    Then the system should return the complete details of the specified product.
*   Given I request the details of a product that does not exist, 
    When I make the request, 
    Then the system should return an appropriate error message.
