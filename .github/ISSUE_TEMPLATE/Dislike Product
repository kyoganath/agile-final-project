**As a** customer, 
**I need** the ability to dislike a product in the catalog, 
**So that** I can filter out products that are not relevant to my interests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Given I am viewing a product, 
    When I click the "Dislike" button, 
    Then the product should be marked as "disliked" for my user account.
*   Given I have previously disliked a product, 
    When I click the "Dislike" button again, 
    Then the "dislike" should be removed.
