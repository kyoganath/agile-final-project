**As a** customer, 
**I need** the ability to like a product in the catalog, 
**So that** I can easily find and revisit products I am interested in.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Given I am viewing a product, 
    When I click the "Like" button, 
    Then the product should be marked as "liked" for my user account.
*   Given I have previously liked a product, 
    When I click the "Like" button again, 
    Then the "like" should be removed.
