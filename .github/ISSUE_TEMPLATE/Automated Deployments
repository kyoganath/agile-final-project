**As a** development team, 
**I need** the ability to automate the deployment of new changes to the cloud environment, 
**So that** the deployment process is efficient and reduces the risk of errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A CI/CD pipeline should be implemented to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   The deployment process should be triggered automatically upon code changes.
*   The deployment process should include automated testing and monitoring.

**Labels:** 
enhancement

**Estimate:** 
13 

**Note:** 
Consider using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to implement the CI/CD pipeline.
