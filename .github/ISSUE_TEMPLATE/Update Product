**As a** store administrator, 
**I need** the ability to update an existing product in the catalog, 
**So that** I can make changes to its details (e.g., price, description, availability).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Given I have the unique identifier of a product and valid updated information, 
    When I submit the update request, 
    Then the product details should be successfully updated in the catalog.
*   Given I attempt to update a product with invalid data (e.g., negative price), 
    When I submit the update request, 
    Then the system should display an error message and prevent the update.
